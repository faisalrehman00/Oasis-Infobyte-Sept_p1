Java Development Internship – Oasis Infobyte
Objective
This repository showcases the projects developed during my 2-month Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The main goal was to apply core Java concepts and object-oriented programming principles to build practical applications.

Projects
Online Reservation System – A simple Java-based system that allows users to book, view, and cancel reservations.

Number Guessing Game – An interactive console-based game where the user guesses a number generated by the system.

ATM Interface – A simulation of an ATM machine with features such as account login, balance inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history.

Steps Performed
Analyzed problem statements and outlined requirements for each project.

Designed flow and structure using OOP principles (classes, objects, methods).

Developed Java code to implement features with proper input validation.

Tested applications with different scenarios to ensure accuracy and usability.

Tools Used
Java (JDK 8+) for development

Eclipse IDE / IntelliJ IDEA for coding and debugging

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

Command-line/Terminal for execution and testing

Outcome
Through this internship, I strengthened my core Java programming skills and gained hands-on experience in building console-based applications. These projects reflect problem-solving, logical thinking, and practical implementation of OOP concepts.
